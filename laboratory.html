          Here are some things I've made &mdash; algorithms, methods,
          packages &mdash; of which I'm particularly proud. As far as I know
          they are novel, but I haven't done deep literature searches to
          find out for sure.

        <h3>Evolutionary Powell's method</h3>

        <p>
          I built Evolutionary Powell's method as a hyperparameter optimization
          algorithm as part of
          <a href="https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com/p/314-neural-network-optimization/">
            Course 314</a>. It is inspired by the original
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powell%27s_method">
            Powell's method</a>, but has a stochastic element
          inspired by evolutionary approaches.

          <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/many-to-many-dijkstra">
            Pathfinder</a> is a many-to-many variant of Dijkstra's
            shortest path algorithm. I got to work on it while at Facebook
            when I was
            <a href"https://engineering.fb.com/connectivity/electrical-grid-mapping/">
              trying to predict the locations of medium-voltage
            electrical distribution grid infrastructure</a>. It's based
            entirely on publicly
            available data sources, including nighttime satellite imagery
            and Open Street Map highways. Here's
            <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/many-to-many-dijkstra/blob/master/Model%20Tutorial%20-%20PDF.pdf">
              a tutorial on how it works and how to re-create it</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chris Arderne did an improved re-implementation, called
          <a href="https://github.com/carderne/gridfinder">
            GridFinder</a> which has been used by the World Bank and
          its partners to estimate the location of medium voltage
          power grids throughout Africa, and then through the rest
          of the world.
