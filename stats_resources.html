        <h3>Where to learn Statistics</h3>
        <p>
          So, you want to learn statistics but you’re not sure where to start?
          Don’t worry. My generous Internet friends on
          <a href=" https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brohrer_statistics-activity-6571698986552479744-gjLa ">LinkedIn</a> and
          <a href=" https://twitter.com/_brohrer_/status/1165933341411106818?s=20 ">Twitter</a> 
          have you covered. Here’s what they recommend.
        </p>

        <p>
          Learning statistics is different than learning the
          multiplication table. It requires learning concepts that
          are abstract and unfamiliar. It’s not enough to have them
          explained once or twice. Like diamonds, it’s helpful to have
          them illuminated from several directions in different kinds
          of light to really get a sense of them. I’ve been through seven
          different statistics courses over the course of my training,
          most of them at the introductory level. Every time I’ve thought,
          "Wow, I understand statistics so much more clearly now."
          And I expect that I will feel that way the next few times too.
        </p>

      
        <p>
          My best advice is to try out a handful of these.
          We are all at different places in our understanding,
          and we all have different ways of seeing the world and
          absorbing new ideas. Nowhere is this more apparent
          then when trying to comprehend entirely new concepts.
          These courses, books, and lectures have all been a perfect
          fit for someone. I encourage you to find the ones that
          are perfect fit for you.
