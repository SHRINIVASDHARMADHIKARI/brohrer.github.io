          First some caveats:
          <ul>
            <li>
              These are my own opinions and may have no relation to the position of my employer.
            </li>
            <li>
              I’m not an expert in this area. These are opinions only.
            </li>
            <li>
              These are not in direct reference to my own experiences with
              specific employers, past or present. Rather, they are an
              aggregation of thoughts based on accumulated experience over a
              lifetime of associations with organizations of all sorts, and the
              second-hand accounts of others.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          I struggled with when to release this post. It's natural to look at whatever happened in the news yesterday and assume it was a trigger. But this has been brewing for decades.
        </p>

        <h3>Help! The leadership of my {academic institution, company,
          nonprofit} did
          something {unethical, illegal, in extremely poor taste}.</h3>
        <h3>What do I do?</h3>

        <p>
          Poor behavior by an organization’s leadership  isn’t an uncommon scenario, nor is it a new one. Most of us will find ourselves in the situation at some point. What do we do? How do we trade off the benefits of membership with the taint of association? This is an intensely personal question, and there’s no way I can answer it for you, but I can offer some starting points for considering your response.
        </p>

        <h3>It hurts</h3>

        <p>
          When this happens, the initial experience is one of pain. You may feel several or all of these.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Betrayal of trust</strong>. This type of behavior is not what you signed on for. Maybe you just wanted satisfying employment or to make the world a little better place. And maybe the leaders have said lofty things about values and vision. Then this happened. It’s a bait-and-switch and you feel betrayed.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Personal injury</strong>. Leaders actions may hurt you directly. Sexual harassment and discrimination are all-to-common ways for this to happen, but it can also come in the form of verbal abuse, recognition withheld, or failing to provide a physically safe work environment.
        </p>
        </p>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Guilt</strong>. You may feel bad about yourself for being part of something that fails to live up to its promises. You might even feel personally accountable for leaders’ actions. This can manifest as a persistent gnawing feeling in your stomach that makes it hard to get out of bed.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Shame</strong>. It’s really natural to feel worried about what other people think-that they judge you as a sellout or a lemming or a pawn, weak or greedy or foolish. They may even say it in a tweet or to your face over holiday dinners. That stings.
        </p>


        <h3>Consider your options</h3>

        <p>
          So it hurts. What can you do about it? You have a few options, and they each come with their own upside and downside.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Gadfly</strong>. Criticize the bad behavior to other members of the org. Make it clear that you disapprove.
        </p>

        <p>
          Upside: You are doing something. You don’t have to suffer in silence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Downside: Leaders may not even be aware of your displeasure, much less feel pressure to change.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Conscience</strong>. Call out the leaders’ poor decisions but emphasize opportunities for improvement. Make a call to be better. Provide specific suggestions for corrective actions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Upside: This is a very constructive approach. It is an expression of trust in your leaders. It gives well meaning and responsive leaders a chance to improve and heal the organization.
        </p>

        <p>
          Downside: Change is hard and so the default human position is to avoid it whenever possible. If leaders are not deliberately looking to improve, they will probably do the minimum, which is to say a few of the right words without making any substantive changes. They also might dismiss the criticism or simply do nothing.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Saboteur</strong>. Stay part of the org but deliberately damage it. One common way is leaking confidential information, but it’s not hard to find others.
        </p>

        <p>
          Upside: You can do real damage this way. If you have lost faith in an organization's leadership completely and have been personally harmed, this method offers a bit of justice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Downside: It is possible that whatever harm you do will touch people in the organization that were not responsible for the offenses. You'll need to consider your path carefully if you want to avoid collateral damage.
        </p>

        <p>
          There's also real danger that the leaders will seek retribution. Depending on the circumstances, your reputation may be attacked, you may be sued, you may be ostracized. Very large organizations have a great deal of power. In extreme cases you can literally spend the rest of your life suffering the consequences. I don't say this to dissuade you, but to encourage you to think through your options carefully.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Martyr</strong>. Public criticism.
        </p>


        <p>
          <strong>Ghost</strong>. Cut affiliation. Find another job. Move on.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Apostate</strong>. Leave and criticize, possibly sabotage.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Do nothing</strong>. Exceeded fucks given. Not worth the fight. Close to retirement/vesting. Good outweighs the bad. Lack of other options. Fear of unknown.
        </p>


        <h3>The leaders of someone else’s organization did something very
          wrong. What do I do?</h3>

        <p>
           This is A similar situation that you are guaranteed to encounter.  Again, the decision of whether and how to respond is yours alone, but I can offer a few points to consider.
        </p>

        <p>
          Organizations are made of people. Remember that the company is made up of the individuals. Individual leaders made very poor decisions. The majority of the people in that company are not responsible for them, and may not support them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pointing at another organization’s failings don’t make up for those in your own.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consider your goals. A Twitter rant feels good but quickly fades into the background. Reporting specific events carries far more weight
        </p>


        <p>
          What do we even mean?

          Reporting?

          .Org reputation?

          .Org actions?

          Personal actions?

          Good and evil

          Suffering
        </p>
