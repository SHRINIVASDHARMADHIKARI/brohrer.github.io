          The experience of seeing the world around us is all but impossible
          to capture in words,
          from the careful steps
          of a marching ant,
          to the works of Pablo Picasso and Beatrix Potter,
          to a solitary oak tree, twisted and dignified.
          It's ridiculous to think that we could ever reduce it all to
          ones and zeros. Except that we have. In fact,
          our images are so realistic now that we go to pains to 
          re-introduce artifacts, like the
          washed out colors of Polaroids or the scratches on celluloid.
        </p>
        <p>
          This may be a blow to romamticism, but it's great luck for
          machine learning practitioners. Reducing images to numbers
          makes them amenable to math and computation.

          Color fascinates me because it is less about physics than it
          is about the physiology and psychology of human perception.
          All of all our standards and definitions are based on and
          limited by what humans perceive. The range that needs to
          be covered, the number of channels necessary to
          represent a color, the resolution with which a color must be
          specified, and hence the information density and
          storage requirements, all depend on human retinas and
          visual cortices.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also means that, as with everything
          human, there is a great deal of variability.
          There are deficiencies like
          <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness">
            color blindness</a>
          (I myself experience
          <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness#Deuteranomaly">
            deuteranomaly</a>
          , a type of
          red-green colorblindness) and there are those with unusual
          abilities, like
          <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachromacy">
            tetrachromats</a>
          , who have not three types of
          color receptors, but four, and can distinguish colors
          that the rest of us can’t.
          Because of this, keep in mind that all of the statements
          we can make about perception are generalizations only,
          and there will be individual differences.

          Although photons vibrate at all frequencies,
          we have three distinct types of color-sensing cones,
          each with its characteristic frequency response.
          That means that a combination of three light sources
          with carefully chosen colors
          in carefully chosen intensities can make us experience
          any color that we're
          capable of seeing in the natural world.

          In computer screens, this is done with a red, a green, and a blue
          light, often light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
        </p>

In practice The red green and blue LEDs in a computer screen can’t  represent all the colors we can see. To make a colored LED, a chemical is introduced that fluoresces at about the right color. These are close to ideal red blue and green but they aren’t perfect. For this reason, there is a little bit of a gap between the range of colors that you can see in the real world and what you can see On a computer screen. Lasers are capable of producing color much closer to the ideal. Current laser projection systems cover much more of the human perceivable gamut, and laser micro arrays for computer screens are current topic of research and development.
