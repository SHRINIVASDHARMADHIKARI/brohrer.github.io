        <h3>Get Started with Git</h3>
        <p>
          You can get by most of your life without Git, until suddenly you
          have to write code with three other people, or worse, have to
          one day start maintaining Amy's computer vision codebase after she leaves the company
          to become a CTO. Then you have half a day to
          become an expert in this quirky little version control tool.
          Not to worry. These teachers have you covered.

          I asked my friends and colleagues on

          ">
            Twitter</a> if the knew of any Git tutorials they would recommend.
          I was overwhelmed by the response. There are a lot to choose from.
          However, a few rose to the top as being both very popular
          and exceptionally well suited for someone just starting out.

        <p>
          Two million YouTube subscribers (to a math channel!) can't be wrong.
          Linear algebra concepts lend themselves to illustration,
          and the beautiful graphics in these videos exploit this fully.
          All the scary terms are explained in straightforward words
          and animations. This is a fantastic place to start, partciularly
          if you have a touch of anxiety about the topic.
        </p>

        <p>
          My first exposure to linear algebra was not gentle. It consisted
          entirely of theorems, proofs, and intimidating words. It was
          quite some time after that first course before I started
          to build an intuition for the concepts. 3Blue1Brown is the
          preparation I wish I'd had then.
        </p>

          By the way, if you find the 3Blue1Brown series helpful,
