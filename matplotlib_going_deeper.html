        <h3>A little bit of big picture goes a long way</h3>
        <p>
          If you remember just these three things, your plotting life will be much
          easier:
        </p>


        <h3>1. Figures hold Axes objects</h3>

        <p>
          Everything is objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every Matplotlib plot exercise begins with a <var>Figure</var>.
          This is exactly what it sounds like, a rectangular blank slate
          that contains everything else. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The name of the Axes object can be pretty confusing.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Axes hold almost everything else</h3>


        <h3>3. Making plots is a complicated business</h3>

        <h3>Method in the madness</h3>
        <p>
          The complexity in Matplotlib is there for good reason.
          Making attractive interactive images on every type of screen
          in every operating system is hard.
          Enabling customization for all our various aesthetics and
          formatting requirements is also hard.
          On top of that, making a simplified interface to this complexity
          that doesn’t scare us all away, but still preserves
          the most useful functionality is harder still.
        </p>

        <p>
          With this in mind, it’s no mean feat that Matplotlib contributors
          have achieved. Started by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Hunter">
            John D. Hunter</a>,
          with the lead developer role passing to Michael Droettboom,
          then to Thomas Caswell, working with a small army of developers,
          Matplotlib's contributors have built, maintain, and expand this tool.
          And every single one of them is a volunteer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Matplotlib has enjoyed organic growth.
          Like so many tools that follow this path,
          it has developed a rich set of features,
          including how large number of shortcuts and labor saving
          syntactic sugar. 
          While the end result is fascinating from a development perspective,
          it’s not always straightforward to work with.
          In this section, we'll walk through a handlful of concepts
          you can use as landmarks as you navigate the terrain.
        </p>

        <p>
          Matplotlib has several ways to do most things,
          and while they provide the experienced user convenience,
          they can also create a lot of confusion. 
          Throughout these examples, we will stick to one way of doing things.
          We will choose the one that most clearly reflects
          the underlying structure, rather than the one that results
          in the shortest code. By picking one way of doing things and
          sticking to it, we'll minimize
          the number of things we have to remember.
